# Detailed Implementation Plan for the Tarpaulin Online Store

## 1. Setup & Dependencies
- Update package.json to include dependencies: Next.js, React, React-DOM, and @supabase/supabase-js.
- Create a .env.local file with:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Ensure error handling for missing environment variables across the app.

## 2. Supabase Client Initialization
**File:** /src/lib/supabaseClient.ts  
- Import and initialize Supabase client using the environment variables.  
- Wrap the creation in a try/catch block to log errors if variables are missing.  
- Export the client for use in authentication and data fetching.

## 3. Global Application Layout
**File:** /src/app/layout.tsx  
- Add a header with a modern, clean navigation bar featuring text links: Home, Products, Cart, Profile, and Admin (visible only for admin users).  
- Use semantic HTML (nav, header) with consistent typography, spacing, and color defined in globals.css.  
- Wrap the main content in a potential AuthProvider to manage session state and error boundaries to catch rendering issues.

## 4. Landing Page & Product Listing
**File:** /src/app/page.tsx  
- Display a featured product section using the ProductCard component.  
- Use an `<img>` tag with:
  - src set to `https://storage.googleapis.com/workspace-0f70711f-8b4e-4d94-86f1-2a93ccde5887/image/1e6f3b9c-f0ee-4ace-953b-7116ec06d633.png`
  - alt text: "High quality tarpaulin display showing detailed product images in a modern layout"
  - onerror handler to gracefully fallback.
- Handle API fetch failures by showing an error message or fallback UI.

## 5. Authentication Flow
**Files:**  
- /src/app/auth/login/page.tsx  
- /src/app/auth/register/page.tsx  
- /src/app/auth/reset/page.tsx  
- Implement forms for login, registration, and password reset using Supabase auth methods.  
- Validate user inputs, display error messages on failure, and wrap async calls in try/catch blocks.

## 6. User Profile & Address Book
**File:** /src/app/profile/page.tsx  
- Create a form to view and update user details and manage an address book.  
- Use Supabaseâ€™s update APIs, with proper validation and error reporting.

## 7. Product Catalog & Detail View
**Files:**  
- /src/app/products/page.tsx  
- /src/app/products/[id]/page.tsx  
- /src/components/ProductCard.tsx  
- Fetch product data from Supabase and display via ProductCard, showing details such as images, specifications, and real-time stock updates.  
- In the product detail page, include multiple placeholders (using proper `<img>` tags) for high-quality product images and detailed descriptions.  
- Wrap API calls in try/catch blocks to capture errors.

## 8. Advanced Search & Filter
**File:** /src/components/SearchFilter.tsx  
- Build an autocomplete search bar and filters (price, material, size, brand, usage).  
- Use controlled inputs to update the state and trigger filtering of products.  
- Include error messaging when search queries or filters return no results.

## 9. Shopping Cart & Checkout
**Files:**  
- /src/components/Cart.tsx  
- /src/app/checkout/page.tsx  
- Create a Cart component that supports adding items, quantity control, removal, and "save for later" logic (persist state via localStorage).  
- Build a checkout page displaying cart summary, shipping & tax calculation, and a secure payment form that simulates multiple methods (credit card, e-wallet, bank transfer).  
- Validate forms and handle payment simulation errors gracefully.

## 10. Tarpaulin Special Features
**Files:**  
- /src/components/SizeCalculator.tsx  
  - Design inputs for custom dimensions and compute recommended tarpaulin size and pricing.
- /src/components/ProductComparison.tsx  
  - Allow users to select up to three products and display a comparison table of specifications.
- /src/components/QuoteRequestForm.tsx  
  - Provide a detailed form for customers to request a custom quote, with validations and error-handling.
- Ensure all special feature UIs have a modern, clean layout using typography, spacing, and color without external icons.

## 11. Admin Panel & Role-Based Access
**File:** /src/app/admin/page.tsx  
- Restrict access via Supabase user roles.  
- Offer administrative functions such as managing products, orders, and user roles.  
- Implement form-based CRUD operations with proper error handling and permission checks.

## 12. Testing & Documentation
- Write curl commands to test authentication endpoints and checkout flows (for example, simulating POST requests and checking status codes).
- Update README.md with setup instructions, environment variable configuration, and guidance on running the app.
- Verify that error boundaries, loading states, and graceful degradation are implemented for production robustness.

# Summary
- The plan integrates Next.js with Supabase to build a fully featured tarpaulin e-commerce platform.  
- Authentication, user management, and role-based access are implemented via dedicated auth pages.  
- A modern product catalog with advanced search, filtering, and detail views is provided.  
- Key e-commerce features include a dynamic shopping cart, secure checkout, and custom tarpaulin tools (size calculator, comparison, quote request).  
- An admin dashboard is included for managing data with proper error handling and form validations.  
- Comprehensive documentation and testing guidelines ensure maintainability and robustness.
